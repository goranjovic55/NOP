# Global Memory - Network Observatory Platform (NOP)

## Project Objectives
- Build a comprehensive network monitoring and assessment platform.
- Focus on asset management, network discovery, and security assessment.
- Provide a modern, "cyberpunk" themed UI for network visibility.

## High-Level Architecture
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) with SQLAlchemy (PostgreSQL) and Redis for task queuing.
- **Frontend**: React (TypeScript) with Tailwind CSS.
- **Discovery**: Nmap-based network scanning integrated into the backend.
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose for multi-container orchestration.

## Key Decisions
- Use relative API paths (`/api/v1`) in the frontend to allow Nginx to proxy requests to the backend, avoiding CORS and environment-specific host issues.
- Implement active discovery logic that marks assets as OFFLINE if they are not found during a network scan.
- Provide user-configurable auto-refresh on the Assets page to maintain real-time visibility of host states.
