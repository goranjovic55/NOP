# Global Memory - Network Observatory Platform (NOP)

## Project Objectives
- Build a comprehensive network monitoring and assessment platform.
- Focus on asset management, network discovery, and security assessment.
- Provide a modern, "cyberpunk" themed UI for network visibility.

## High-Level Architecture
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) with SQLAlchemy (PostgreSQL) and Redis for task queuing.
- **Frontend**: React (TypeScript) with Tailwind CSS.
- **State Management**: Zustand for global scan and auth state.
- **Discovery**: Nmap-based network scanning integrated into the backend.
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose for multi-container orchestration.

## Key Decisions
- Use relative API paths (`/api/v1`) in the frontend to allow Nginx to proxy requests to the backend.
- Implement a multi-tab scan interface to allow concurrent detailed assessments of multiple hosts.
- Separate "Discovery" (ARP/Ping) from "Detailed Scanning" (Nmap) to optimize network performance and safety.
- Use local storage to persist detailed scan results (OS, ports) and merge them with backend discovery data.
- Implement PPS (Packets Per Second) control for discovery to prevent network storming.
