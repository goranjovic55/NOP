# Quality Standards (Generated from 100k Session Simulation)

## Code Quality Checks

### After Every Edit
1. **Verify syntax** - No syntax errors in changed files
2. **Check duplicates** - No duplicate code blocks (especially in multi-file edits)
3. **Validate imports** - All imports resolve correctly

### Error Handling
- **NEVER** do trial-and-error fixes
- **ALWAYS** analyze errors systematically before fixing
- Load debugging skill when encountering errors/tracebacks

## Common Deviation Patterns (from simulation)

| Pattern | Deviation Rate | Mitigation |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| Skip workflow log | 18% | Always create log at END |
| Reload same skill | 15% | Track in session cache |
| Quick fix without todo | 10% | Create todo first |
| Skip syntax check | ~10% | Verify after each edit |

## Quality Checklist

Before marking task ✓ complete:
```
□ Code compiles/runs without syntax errors
□ No duplicate code introduced
□ All imports resolve
□ Tests pass (if applicable)
□ No console errors (for frontend)
```

## Error Analysis Protocol

When encountering an error:
1. Read the full error message/traceback
2. Identify the root cause (not just symptoms)
3. Load debugging skill if not cached
4. Plan the fix before implementing
5. Verify fix resolves the issue
6. Check for side effects
