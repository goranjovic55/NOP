# Quality Standards

## After Every Edit
1. Verify syntax (no errors)
2. Check duplicates (multi-file edits)
3. Validate imports

## Error Protocol
1. READ full error/traceback
2. ANALYZE root cause (not symptoms)
3. Load debugging skill
4. PLAN fix before implementing
5. VERIFY fix resolves issue

## Common Deviations

| Pattern | Rate | Fix |
|---------|------|-----|
| Skip workflow log | 18% | Create at END |
| Reload skill | 15% | Cache skills |
| Quick fix no todo | 10% | Todo first |
| Skip syntax check | 10% | Verify after edit |

## Checklist
□ No syntax errors | □ No duplicates | □ Imports resolve | □ Tests pass
