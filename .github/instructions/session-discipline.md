# Session Discipline

Keep context through long sessions.

## Core Habits

| Habit | When |
|-------|------|
| Load knowledge first | Session start, always |
| Track via todos | Every piece of work |
| Check skills before edit | Before touching files |
| Mark status immediately | Before/after each task |
| Run scripts at end | After approval, before commit |

---

## Interrupts

```
Current task → User asks something new
    ↓
Mark current ⊘ <PAUSED>
Create <SUB:1> for new request
Handle it, mark ✓
Change <PAUSED> back to <WORK>
Continue original task
```

---

## Long Sessions

Every ~5 tasks:
```
□ Check: todos up to date?
□ Check: any ⊘ paused items?
□ Check: skills loaded for files I edited?
```

---

## If Lost

```
1. Stop
2. Show worktree
3. Find next ○ pending task
4. Continue from there
```
