# Todo Creation

Create TODO list for multi-step tasks to maintain visibility and track progress.

## When to Create TODO

- Multi-file changes (3+ files)
- User provides numbered tasks
- Complex feature implementation
- Bug fix requiring investigation

## TODO Format

```
<MAIN> Primary goal
  <WORK:1> First subtask ○
  <WORK:2> Second subtask ○
  ...
  <END> Wrap up ○
```

## Status Symbols

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ○ | Not started |
| ◆ | In progress (only ONE at a time) |
| ✓ | Completed |
| ⊘ | Paused |
| ⧖ | Delegated |

## Rules

1. Create TODO before starting work on multi-step tasks
2. Mark task ◆ BEFORE editing
3. Mark task ✓ IMMEDIATELY after completing
4. Only ONE ◆ task at a time
5. Close all ⊘ paused tasks before END
