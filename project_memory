# Project Memory - Network Observatory Platform (NOP)

## Current Project State
The project is now in a functional state with core authentication and discovery features working end-to-end. Docker containers are configured to provide a realistic testing environment with multiple target hosts.

## Recent Work Completed
- **Authentication Fixes**: 
    - Resolved backend crashes by allowing extra environment variables in Pydantic settings.
    - Implemented automatic admin password synchronization on startup.
    - Added a utility script for manual admin password resets.
- **Discovery & Asset Management**:
    - Refined `DiscoveryService` to correctly process Nmap results and populate the Assets database.
    - Implemented automatic asset type classification based on open ports.
- **Frontend Enhancements**:
    - Updated the **Scans** page to trigger real backend scans instead of simulations.
    - Implemented real-time polling for scan results.
    - Verified the **Assets** page correctly displays discovered hosts from the Docker network.
- **Infrastructure**:
    - Configured `docker-compose.yml` with a dedicated `test-network` and multiple target containers (Web, SSH, DB, File servers).

## Key Decisions
- **Security**: Core services are isolated on `nop-internal` network; only the Frontend is exposed.
- **Portability**: Used `extra = "ignore"` in Pydantic to ensure the backend doesn't crash in different Docker environments.

## Next Steps
- Implement real-time traffic sniffing with WebSocket streaming.
- Add PCAP export functionality.
- Enhance the dashboard with analytics from discovered assets.
