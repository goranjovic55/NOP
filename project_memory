# Project Memory - Current State

## Recent Changes
- **Multi-Tab Scan Interface**: Rebuilt `Scans.tsx` with a tabbed UI, manual IP entry, and detailed Nmap-style log simulation.
- **Global Scan Indicators**: Added pulsing red indicators to the sidebar and logo to show active background operations.
- **Advanced Asset Management**:
    - Implemented subnet filtering and numerical IP sorting.
    - Added "Intel" column showing "Scanned" status and last scan timestamp.
    - Integrated real-time updates between Scans and Assets pages.
- **Discovery Optimization**:
    - Restricted Assets page scans to ARP/Ping only.
    - Added PPS (Packets Per Second) timing control to discovery settings.
- **Test Environment**: Randomized test host IPs and updated simulation logic to match.
- **UI Cleanup**: Removed "Exploit" button from asset details; focused on "Connect" and "Scan" workflows.

## Current Status
- Core discovery and detailed scanning workflows are fully implemented and integrated in the UI.
- Real-time feedback and cross-page state synchronization are operational.
- Test environment is randomized and verified for multi-host discovery.

## Next Steps
- Implement SSH/VNC/RDP routing for the "Connect" button.
- Connect the frontend scan configuration to the actual backend Nmap/ZMap service.
- Implement the "Access Hub" for managing active connections.
